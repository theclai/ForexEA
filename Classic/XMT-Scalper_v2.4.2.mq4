//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Version history:
//
// Someone at a russian forum fixed a Stack Overflow problem, added NDD-mode (ECN-mode) 
// and moved the DLL-functions in the mql4-code, and uploaded "MillionDollarPips - 
// (ANY PAIR + NO DLL) - ver 1.1.0".
//
// Sept-2011 by Capella by at http://www.worldwide-invest.org
// - Cleaned code from unused code, proper variable names and sub-names.
//
// Ver. 1.0 - 2011-09-24 by Capella at http://www.worldwide-invest.org
// - Added Print lines for STOPLEVEL when errors (for debugging purposes)
// - Removed unused externals and variables
// - Moved dynamic TP/SL and trading signals constants to externals, 
//   as VolatilityLimit and Scalpfactor.
// - Forced TrailingStop
//
// Ver. 2.0 - 2011-10-19  by Capella
// - Fixing bugs, and removed unused code.
// - Forced Trailing, as no-trailing cannot generate profit
// - Forced HighSpeed, as false mode cannot give good result
// - Added additional settings for scalping - UseMovingAverage, 
//   UseBollingerBands, and OrderExpireSeconds
// - Automatic adjusted to broker STOPLEVEL, to avoid OrderSend error 130
// Ver 2.1 - 2011-11-91 by Capella
// - Added Indicatorperiod as external
// - Modified calculation of variable that triggers trade (local_pricedirection)
// - Removed Distance as an external, and automatically adjust Distance to be the same as stoplevel 
// - Removed call for sub_moveandfillarrays as it doesn't make any difference
// Ver 2.1.1 - 2011-11-05 by Capella
// - Fixed a bug in the calculation of highest and lowest that caused wrong call for 
//   OrderModify.
// - Changed the calculation of STOPLEVEL to also consider FREEZELEVEL
// Ver 2.1.2 - 2011-11-06 by Capella
// - Changed default settings according to optimized backtests
// - Added external parameter Deviation for iBands, default 0
// Ver 2.1.3 - 2011-11-07 by Capella
// - Fixed a bug for calculation of local_isbidgreaterthanindy
// Ver 2.1.4 - 2011-11-09 by Capella
// - Fixed a bug that only made the robot trade on SELL and SELLSTOP
// - Put back the call for the sub "sub_moveandfillarrays" except the last nonsense part of it.
// - Changed the default settings and re-ordered the global variables
// Ver 2.1.5 - 2011-11-10 by Capella
// - Fixed a bug that caused the robot to not trade for some brokers (if variable "local_scalpsize" 
//   was 0.0) 
// - Fixed a bug that could cause the lot-size to be calculated wrongly
// - Better output of debug information (more information)
// - Moved a fixed internal Max Spread to an external. The default internal value was 40 (4 pips), 
//   which is too high IMHI 
// - Renamed some local variables to more proper names in order to make the code more readable
// - Cleaaned code further by removing unused code, etc.
// Ver 2.1.5a - 2011-11-15 by blueprint1972
// - Added Execution time in log files, to measure how fast orders are executed at the broker server
//
// Ver 2.2 - 2011-11-17 by Capella
// - An option to calculate VelocityLimit dynamically based on the spread 
// - Removed parameter Scalpfactor as it had no impact on the trading conditions, only on lotsize
// - Better lot calculation, now entirely based on FreeMargin, Risk and StopLoss
// - A new scalp factor called VolatilityPercentageLimit based on the difference between 
//   VolatilityLimit and iHigh / iLow for triggering trades
// - Can now trade automatically on all currency pairs within spread limit from one single chart 
// - Works on 4-digit brokers as well. Note: Performance on 4-digit brokers is worse than on 
//   5-digit brokers, and there are much less trades
// Ver 2.2.1 - 2011-11-18 by Capella
// - Fixed a bug for calculation of Commission. The variables "local_commissionpips" and 
//   "local_commissionfactor" moved from locals to globals.
